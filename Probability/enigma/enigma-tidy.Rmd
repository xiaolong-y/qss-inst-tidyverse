![The Enigma Machine](pics/enigma.jpg)

The Enigma machine is the most famous cipher machine to date. Nazi Germany used it during World War II to encrypt messages so that enemies could not understand them. The story of the British cryptanalysts who successfully deciphered Enigma has become the subject of multiple movies *Enigma* (2001); *The Imitation Game* (2014). In this exercise, we will focus our attention on a simplified version of the Enigma machine, which we call the "Little Enigma." Like the real Enigma machine shown above, this machine consists of two key components. First, the Little Enigma machine has 5 different *rotors*, each of which comes with 10 pins with numbers ranging from 0 to 9. Second, a component called the *plugboard* contains 26 holes, corresponding to the 26 letters of the alphabet. In addition, 13 cables connect all possible pairs of letters. Since a cable has two ends, one can connect, for example, the letter A with any other of the other 25 letters present in the plugboard.

To either encode a message or decode an encrypted message, one must provide the Little Enigma machine with a correct five-digit passcode to align the rotors and a correct configuration of the plugboard. The rotors are set up just like many combination locks. For example, the passcode 9--4--2--4--9 means that five rotors display the numbers 9, 4, 2, 4, and 9 in that order. In addition, the 13 cables connecting the letters in the plugboard must be appropriately configured. The purpose of the plugboard is thus to scramble the letters. For example, if B is connected to W, the Little Enigma machine will switch B with W and W with B to encode a message or decode an encoded message. Thus, a sender types a message on the keyboard, the plugboard scrambles the letters, and the message is sent in its encrypted form. A receiver decodes the encrypted message by re-typing it on a paired Little Enigma machine that has the same passcode and plugboard configuration.

## Question 1

How many different five-digit passcodes can be set out of the 5
rotors?

## Answer 1

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
log.rotors <- 5 * log(10)
log.rotors
``` 

We know that each rotor has 10 pins.  Thus, for each rotor we have 10 possible choices to select a one-digit number. Since we have five rotors, the total number of five-digit passcodes is given by $10^5$. We take the logarithmic transformation since the number is large and save the value for later use.

## Question 2

How many possible configurations does the plugboard provide?  In other words, how many ways can 26 letters be divided into 13 pairs?

## Answer 2
```{r}
n <- seq(from = 26, to = 2, by = -2)
log_nCk <- lchoose(n, 2)
## recall log(AB) = log(A) + log(B)
log.allways <- sum(log_nCk)
exp(log.allways)
```

We first count all possible ways to make 13 pairs out of 26 letters. There are $_{26}C_2 = \text{choose}(26, 2)$ ways to choose the first pair. Once the first pair is selected, there are $_{24}C_2= \text{choose}(24, 2)$ ways to choose the second pair. The same process can be repeated until all 13 pairs are selected. Therefore, the total number of pairs is given by $_{26} C_2 \times _{24}C_2 \times _{22}C_2 \times \ldots \times _2C_2$.  We compute this in R.

However, not all of these pairs are unique. To see this point, suppose we only have 4 letters *A,B,C,D*.  Using the same logic as above, there are $_4C_2 \times _2C_2 = 6$ ways, in which we can construct 2 pairs. One of the possible ways is given by pairing *A* with *D* first and then pairing *B* with *C*. Another possibility is to pair *B* and *C* first and then pair *A* and *D* next. But, these two ways are equivalent. Since the order of pair creation does not matter, we must divide the total number we obtained above by the total number of ways in which we can arrange 13 pairs, i.e., $_{13}P_{13} = 13!$. Thus, the total number of ways to set the plugboard is given by,

```{r}
log.plugboard <- log.allways - lfactorial(13)
exp(log.plugboard)
```

## Question 3

Based on the previous two questions, what is the total number of possible settings for the Little Enigma machine?

## Answer 3

```{r}
log.enigma <- log.rotors + log.plugboard
exp(log.enigma)
```

To obtain the total number of possible settings for Little Enigma, we
just need to realize that for every five-digit passcode, we will have
$`r exp(log.plugboard)`$ ways to order the plugboard. Thus, the total
number of settings is given by,

## Question 4

Five cryptanalytic machines have been developed to decode 1,500 messages encrypted by the Little Enigma machine. The table below presents information on the number of messages assigned to each machine and the machine's failure rate (i.e., the percentage of messages the machine was unable to decode). Aside from this information, we do not know anything about the assignment of each message to a machine or whether the machine was able to correctly decode the message.

Machine       Number of messages Failure Rate
------------- ------------------ ------------
`Banburismus`                300          10%
`Bombe`                      400           5%
`Herivel`                    250          15%
`Crib`                       340          17%
`Hut 6`                      210          20% 

Suppose that we select one message at random from the pool of all 1,500 messages but found out this message was not properly decoded. Which machine is most likely responsible for this mistake?

## Answer 4

```{r} 
## P(M_i)
pM <- c(300, 400, 250, 340, 210) # number of messages
pM <- pM / sum(pM) 
## Failure rates p(U | M_i)
pUM <- c(0.1, 0.05, 0.15, 0.17, 0.2)
## P(M_i | U)
pMU <- pM * pUM / sum(pM * pUM)
pMU
```

Define $P(M_i)$ as the probability that a randomly chosen message was assigned to machine $i$. Let $U$ denote the event that some machine failed to decode a message. Then, we are interested in determining machine $i$ for which $P(M_i \mid U)$ is the greatest. Applying Bayes' rule, we have,

$$
 P(M_i \mid U) \ = \ \frac{P(U \mid M_i) P(M_i)}{P(U)} \ = \
 \frac{P(U \mid M_i) P(M_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^5 P(U \mid M_j) P(M_j)} 
$$

where $P(U \mid M_i)$ is the failure rate for each machine. We can compute this probability for each machine using R.

From this result, we conclude that 'Crib', which corresponds to thefourth and largest probability, is most likely responsible for the failure to decode the message.

## Question 5

Write an R function that randomly configures the plugboard. This function will take no input but randomly selects a set of 13 pairs of letters. The output object should be a $2 \times 13$ matrix for which each column represents a pair of letters. You may use the built-in R object `letters`, which contains the 26 letters of the alphabet as a character vector.  Name the function `plugboard`.

## Answer 5

```{r}
plugboard <- function() {
  ltrs <- sample(letters, size = length(letters),
                 replace = FALSE)
  tibble(from = ltrs[1:(length(ltrs) / 2)],
         to = ltrs[((length(ltrs) / 2) + 1):length(ltrs)])
}
plug_config <- plugboard()
plug_config
```

To sample pairs we only need to shuffle the letters vector (sample without replacement the same number of times as the number of elements), and use the first thirteen letters as the first items in the pairs, and the second thirteen as the second items. We will return a 2 x 13 data frame with columns from and to.

## Question 6

Write an R function that encodes and decodes a message given a
plugboard configuration set by the `plugboard` function from the
previous question. This function should take the output of the
`plugboard` function as well as a message to be encoded (decoded) as
inputs, and return an encoded (decoded) message. You may find some functions from the `stringr` package useful in working with the text, including functions to change the case of text and splitting text into smaller pieces (e.g. into letters).

## Answer 6

```{r}
little_enigma <- function(x, plug_config) {
  plugs <-
    bind_rows(
      # 13 letters from -> to
      plug_config,
      # reversed to -> from
      select(plug_config, from = to, to = from),
      # uppercase from -> to
      mutate(plug_config,
             from = toupper(from),
             to = toupper(to)),
      # uppercase reversed to -> from
      mutate(plug_config,
             from = toupper(to),
             to = toupper(from))
    )
  
  # convert to data frame
  x <- tibble(from = strsplit(x, "")[[1]]) %>%
    # merge with plugs
    left_join(plugs, by = "from") %>%
    # replace missing values of to with from 
    mutate(to = coalesce(to, from))
  
  paste(x[["to"]], collapse = "")
}

text <- "hello little enigma" 
## encode text
text_encoded <- little_enigma(text, plug_config)
text_encoded
## decode it 
little_enigma(text_encoded, plug_config)
```
The above function takes a message `x` and a plugboard configuration `plug_config` and returns the encoded message. The same function then can be used to decode an encoded message.
