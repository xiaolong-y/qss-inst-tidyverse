# Lesson Plan for The Mathematics of Enigma

## Before Class

1. Read Chapters 6.3 of QSS
2. Completed swirl lessons for Chapter 6 (PROBABILITY2)
3. Download precept materials

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Probability Review (10 - 15 minutes)

  * Ask about experiences with R/Swirl. This week we are doing probability, and based on the number of errors on the PROBABILITY1 module, we should be prepared to discuss some of the Swirl exercises (students seem to be most confused about 6 and 11)
  * Clarify/ Go over some of the concepts your group seemed to struggle most with. Alternatively briefly review the concepts learned in lecture this week. 
  
### 2. Main activity: "Enigma" (50 - 55 minutes)

  * No data required.
  * You may choose to go over relevant concepts that were not reviewed above, when going over Swirl questions, before each question, e.g. Permutations/Combinations before Q1-3; Bayes'Rule before Q4. 
  * Work though Questions 1 - 3 as a class activity. Ask students to participate, i.e. offer ideas for how to answer the question. Use the blackboard to facilitate showing the concept/code.
  * Start Question 4 as a group, going through the thinking process behind solving this kind of problem, then let them work in pairs or on their own at writing the code in R.
  * Question 5 is a bonus question. If time allows, ask students to work in pairs in order to practice loops and sampling from a distribution. Discuss the difference between an analytical solution and a simulated estimate before students start working on the question.  
  
### 3. Wrap-up (5 minutes)
  * Have them submit their Rmarkdown file to the corresponding Precept section folder under Course Materials.
