## Instructors' public repository for [Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction in tidyverse](https://qss.princeton.press/)

This repository contains the original `R Markdown` (Rmd) and `Quarto` (qmd) files, and pdf slides used for
teaching the tidyverse syntax of R programming with QSS-tidyverse at the [University of Tokyo in 2022 Summer](https://kosukeimai.github.io/qss-todai/). Feel free to use them for your
teaching. 

1. [Introduction](INTRO)
