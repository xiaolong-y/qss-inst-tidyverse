# QSS-inst-tidyverse 

## Instructors' public repository for [Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction in tidyverse](https://qss.princeton.press/)

This repository contains the original `R Markdown` (Rmd) and `Quarto` (qmd) files, and pdf slides (contained in `pdf_slides` folders) used for
teaching the tidyverse syntax of R programming with QSS-tidyverse textbook at the [University of Tokyo in 2022 Summer](https://kosukeimai.github.io/qss-todai/). All materials are put together by the teaching assistants of QSS UTokyo 2022. Please feel free to use them for your
teaching. 

1. [Introduction](Introduction): introduction to tidyverse
2. [Causality](Causality): `dplyr` and the `magrittr` pipe operator
3. [Measurement](Measurement): `ggplot2` and `tidymodels`
4. [Prediction](Prediction): `stringr`, `lubridate`, `tidyr`, `broom` and `modelr`
5. [Probability](Probability): column-wise operations with `dyplr`, writing mathematics (`LaTeX`) and inline codes in Rmarkdown
6. [Uncertainty](Uncertainty): `purrr`, data types in R, code style, for loops, functionals and review of tidyverse 

## Contribution and other resources
We welcome your contributions too.  Please help us improve the existing
teaching materials so that more instructors can use them.  To

In addition, you might want to look at the following resources:

- [QSS main repository](https://github.com/kosukeimai/qss) contains
  all the data sets used in the manuscript

- [QSS learnr repository](https://github.com/mattblackwell/qsslearnr)
  contains interactive [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) exercises tutorials based on Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction by [Kosuke Imai](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/) from Princeton University Press. Currently, the exercises are only availble in baseR. 

- [QSS learnr-tidyverse repository](https://github.com/annayrzy/qsslearnr-tidy)
  contains interactive [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) exercises tutorials based on Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction in tidyverse by [Kosuke Imai](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/) and [Nora Webb Williams](https://norawebbwilliams.github.io/) from Princeton University Press. This repository contains both baseR and tidyverse version of the exercises.
