## Instructors' public repository for [Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction in tidyverse](https://qss.princeton.press/)

This repository contains the original `R Markdown` (Rmd) and `Quarto` (qmd) files, and pdf slides used for
teaching the tidyverse syntax of R programming with QSS-tidyverse at the [University of Tokyo in 2022 Summer](https://kosukeimai.github.io/qss-todai/). Feel free to use them for your
teaching.

2. [Causality](Causality)
3. [Measurement](Measurement)
4. [Prediction](Prediction)
5. [Discovery](Discovery)
6. [Probability](Probability)
7. [Uncertainty](Uncertainty)

We welcome your contributions too.  Please help us improve the existing
